Simple java game engine
=======================

This engine was developed as an assignment of the Advanced Programming class
given by Vicenç Soler Ruíz in the Bachelor's degree in Mathematics at UAB.

It consist of an engine to develop games that resemble `Space Invaders
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders>`_, the original objective of the
assignment, like `Breakout
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)>`_, `Bubble Shooter
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Shooter>`_ and `Tetris
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris>`_.

The package contains the engine, as well as two implementations of such games
(Breakout and Space Invaders) using it.

There is also a space invaders game developed initially without the engine,
which was done initially to test the waters, and to make sure I fulfilled the
assignment if I couldn't finish the engine.

It is no coincidence these are all retro games: they are the only ones simple
enough to be able to make use of this package.
